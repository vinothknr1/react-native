React Native: Core Components, Styling & Colors - More Information
In this course, we'll use and style many components in many apps - hence you'll get lots of insights and practice opportunities, when it comes to styling and building user interfaces.

Still, every app has different requirements, hence I also strongly recommend exploring the official styling documentation: https://reactnative.dev/docs/style

You also might want to explore the official article about "Colors" to learn about different ways of setting & using colors in React Native apps: https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors (in this course, we'll primarily use hex code colors).

It's also worth exploring the official API reference articles for the different core components you might be using. For example, you can learn about all the props that can be set on the <View> component here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/view

From this article, you can also get to the supported style properties for this component (via https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#style): https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props
